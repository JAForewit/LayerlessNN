# Organic Neural Network (ONN)

While inspiration for this project came from my knowledge of biological brains, I realize that implementation removes many of the simulatrities.

## Concept

An ONN (1) has no implied structure and (2) treats neurons as objects which accept 1 or more inputs to generate an output value.

#### Feed forward algorithm

I am considering

#### Backpropegation algorithm
